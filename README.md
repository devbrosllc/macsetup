# Installing Brew Packages
Install all of the packages mentioned in the `brew.txt` file by running `xargs brew install < brew.txt`

# Sample Directory structure
Included is a sample directory structure that can be copied directly into your $HOME folder to get yourself going. The `README`'s that are included are just so git preserves the folder structure. You can remove them once you have copied them into your $HOME folder by running `find . -name 'README.md' -delete`
